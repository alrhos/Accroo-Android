# Accroo-Android

Accroo is a simple budgeting app that makes it easy to keep track of your income and expenses. Unlike other budgeting apps, Accroo is designed from the ground up to put user privacy first and ensures that your information remains completely private to you at all times. All of the information you enter into the app is encrypted on your device with a key that is never shared with anyone. This ensures that no one else, not even Accroo, can access your information.


FAQs

<i>Why can't you send me a link to reset my password if I forget it?</i>

Accroo is an app that is private by design. Your password is used for encrypting your personal information (including transactions and categories) on your device and it is never transmitted. This means that Accroo servers never receive or store your password so it is impossible for Accroo to provide a means to recover or reset your password if you forget it. While this may be inconvenient if you forget your password, it is the only way to guarantee that you, and only you, can access your information.

<i>I can't access the email address I used to register. What can I do?</i>

Unfortunately if you lose access to the email address you used to register you won't be able to receive verification codes that are required for signing in and changing your password or email. This means that you'll need to register a new account with a new email address.

<i>How does Accroo make money?</i>

It doesn't. Accroo is free for everyone.
